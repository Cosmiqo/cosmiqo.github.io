      <description>What is the Largest Problem Most Warehouses Face?The answer is dead-time. Dead-time is time where there’s no actual productivity i.e. during travelling.More than 35% of operations is dead-time. Most businesses are losing a significant portion of their productivity to dead-time without knowing it.Supercharge ProductivityIRIS for people-centric warehousing enables faster, more accurate, andflexible operations in order to attain greater warehouse throughput.Increase warehouse velocityLess dead-time means more time fulfilling jobs and increasingrevenues.</description>
